## 💡 Cursor Development Notes
- **✅ Cursor-Friendly**: Well-defined, incremental tasks
- **⚠️ Cursor-Caution**: Requires design decisions or complex logic
- Focus on **data structure first**, then **functionality**, then **polish**
- Each phase builds logically on the previous one
- Prioritize **user value** over **technical complexity**

Focus: **functional tool first, AI enhancement later**.
